#Project Name
In this project, I have developed a web scraping application using Python and Django. This application allows users to scrape specific HTML elements in URL addresses entered by users.

###Installation
To run this project, Python and pip must be installed.

1.Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
2.Create a virtual environment: python3 -m venv myenv
3.Activate the virtual environment: source myenv/bin/activate
4.Install required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
5.Run the Django project: python manage.py runserver

###Usage
1.To access the application, go to http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
2.On the home page, there are three input boxes.
3.Enter the URL address of the site you want to scrape in the "Enter URL" box.
4.Enter the name of the HTML element you want to scrape in the "Enter HTML element name" box (e.g. div, h1, span, etc.).
5.Enter the class of the HTML element you want to scrape in the "Enter the element class" box.
6.Click the "Scrape" button.
7.The results will be displayed on the same page in a table.

###Examples
Below is an example of a website scraped using the application.

Site Name	HTML Element	Element Class	                Value
YouTube	        div	        style-scope ytd-channel-name	YouTube
